# Baking App

The 3rd Project in the Udacity Android Nanodegree program

The purpose of this project is to create a Android Baking App that allows the user to share some pre-defined recipes. The app will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

This app will:
  - Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
  - Handle error cases in Android.
  - Add a widget to your app experience.
  - Leverage a third-party library in your app.
  - Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
